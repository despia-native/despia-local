This repository is generated from the Despia monorepo folder `OpenSource/Local`
(commit `2b900ca0b913a5acc94d7f6cd501beaa2cf2d1fe`).

- Please do not open pull requests here. Changes land in the monorepo, where
  the engine conformance gates run, and the next sync replaces this tree.
- `conformance/`, when present, is a vendored copy of the shared corpus that
  the Swift reference and the Kotlin kernel also run; `npm test` runs it
  standalone here.
- Tags are cut automatically when the package version changes upstream.
